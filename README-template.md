I completed this challenge to enhance my skills in CSS. This was one of my first times using media queries. I also wanted to increase my knowledge of flexbox and grid and work on more real life challenges.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
